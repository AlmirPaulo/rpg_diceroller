	<h1>Where is the rooms?</h1>
	<p>You need to create them. In the main page, type the title of the room (something like the title of your campaign, or something you and your friends would like) and a password (just to assure you and your friends will not be bothered by no one else). Then click "Create room" and v√≥ila! there is your room.</p>
	<p>If your GM or any other player already has created a room, just ask him for the title and the password. Type them in the same fields, in the same page and now click "Enter room". </p>
	<h1>How to use the diceroller?</h1>
	<p>Well, if you are used to RPG concepts, you will get it fast. But let me help you a little, just in case you are having some hard time.</p>
	
	<!--img-->

	<ol>
		<li>Type the player or character name. I suggest the character name.</li>
		<li>Write the action the character are trying.</li>
		<li>Set how many dices you want to roll.</li>
		<li>Set the kind of dice you want to roll.</li>
		<li>Set any modifier to add or subtract from the roll. If there is none, choose 0.</li>
		<li>Now click the button to roll your dices!</li>
	</ol>
	<h1>In case you are in a mobile device</h1>
	<p>I recomend you the horizontal orientation to use this website. I'm sorry if this is bothering you. We will try to improve this.</p>
<h1>Why this project?</h1>
<p>I always loved tabletop RPGs. And I know nowadays we have a ton of ways to play online. I just would like we could have a simple, fast and direct way. Without logins, accounts, whatever... Just want to roll my dices!</p>
<p>This is why there is no chat. You can chat with your players at Telegram, Whatsapp, Discord, Skype... I don't know! Choose one and be happy! You are already doing this, right now, I know... Just turn your chat in a gameplay. </p>
<h1>Plans for the future</h1>
<p>Maybe we can have more tools like, maps, grids, player stats... But no, no chats!</p>
