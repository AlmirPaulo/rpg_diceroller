# RPG Diceroller
*A Project by [Almir Paulo](https://almirpaulo.github.io)* 

An RPG diceroller web application made in JS in the Front-end and Python in the Back-end. Pretty simple to use, but complete. All the most used RPG dices are available and the outcomes of the rolls follow a pattern very common to the most traditional RPG task resolution systems.

Now you can play online RPG anyway your group decide: Skype, Hangout, Telegram, Discord, Zoom, Email, Forums, whatever... You can roll all your dices on our diceroll room. No need to create accounts, just create the room and roll your dices.
